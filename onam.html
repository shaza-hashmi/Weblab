<p>Onam is an annual 10-day harvest festival celebrated by the Malayali community in Kerala, India, during the Malayalam month of Chingam (August-September) to commemorate the homecoming of the mythical King Mahabali. </p>
<p>Onam commemorates the return of the generous daitya king Mahabali after he was banished to the netherworld by Vamana (the fifth avatar of Hindu deity Vishnu). According to the Hindu legends, after Indra (the king of the devas) is defeated by Mahabali (the king of the asuras), the devas ultimately seek refuge in Vishnu, who agrees to restore Indra to power. To do so, Vishnu incarnates as a dwarf priest called Vamana. Mahabali (himself a devotee of Vishnu) conducts ritual prayers, one of which is attended by Vamana, who requests only three feet (steps) of land to build a fire-altar. Mahabali agrees, despite being told about Vamana's divine nature by the sage Shukra. Vamana grows in size, and in three strides, encompasses all of the universe and beyond. The three worlds are restored to Indra, and Mahabali and the asuras are banished to the netherworld (Patala).However, witnessing Mahabali's love for his subjects, Vamana grants the king's sole wish to visit his kingdom once every year. This homecoming of Mahabali is celebrated as Onam in Kerala every year.</p>
<p> Key features include Pookalam (flower carpets), the grand Onasadya (feast on a banana leaf), traditional boat races like Vallam Kali, folk dances such as Pulikali (tiger dances), and various other cultural activities that symbolize unity, prosperity, and the rich heritage of Kerala.  </p>
